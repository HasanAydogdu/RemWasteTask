Java-Selenium-Cucumber Framework

  This project is an automation framework built using Selenium WebDriver and Cucumber (BDD).
  It is designed as a scalable template to automate:
  
    UI Testing (https://www.saucedemo.com/)
    
    API Testing (https://petstore.swagger.io/)

  The goal is to create a flexible, easy-to-extend automation structure where UI, API layers can be covered

How to Run

  1.Clone or download the repository.
  
  2.Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA (or any Java IDE).
  
  3.Ensure Maven dependencies are installed (mvn clean install).
  
  4.Run the CukesRunner.java class to execute all scenarios.
  
  5.Alternatively, use Maven command-line to execute tests.

NOTE:https://www.saucedemo.com has no swagger document, so I used https://petstore.swagger.io/ for intro. Some of the negative API functions are not working properly due to its alive and changing web life. But I demonstrated all main requirements by using restassured.
